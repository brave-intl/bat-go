## Building using docker

You can build a docker image without installing the go toolchain. Ensure docker
is installed then run `make docker`.

## Developer Setup

1. [Install Go 1.10](https://golang.org/doc/install) (NOTE: Go 1.9 and earlier will not work!)

2. Run `go get -d github.com/brave-intl/bat-go`.

3. [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) is used to install the dependencies.  If you do not have dep, you need to [install it](https://github.com/golang/dep#setup). On mac:
`brew install dep`

4. `cd` into `~/go/github.com/brave-intl/bat-go`, then run `dep ensure` to install the dependencies

5. Build via `make`

6. Run the server executable `./grant-server`
